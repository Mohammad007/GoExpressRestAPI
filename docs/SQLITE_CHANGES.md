# SQLite Implementation Changes

## Overview of Changes

To address the issue with SQLite requiring CGO to be enabled, the following changes have been implemented:

1. Added support for a pure Go SQLite implementation that doesn't require CGO
2. Updated the database initialization code to better handle CGO-related errors
3. Enhanced the database configuration documentation
4. Set the default database type to `sqlite-pure` for better compatibility

## Key Improvements

### 1. Pure Go SQLite Implementation

The application now includes the `github.com/glebarez/sqlite` package, which provides a pure Go implementation of SQLite that doesn't require CGO. This allows the application to use SQLite even when CGO is disabled.

### 2. Better Error Handling

The database initialization code now provides more helpful error messages when encountering CGO-related issues, with clear instructions on how to resolve them.

### 3. Updated Configuration Options

The database configuration now includes a new `sqlite-pure` type that explicitly uses the pure Go SQLite implementation. The default database type has been changed to `sqlite-pure` for better compatibility.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Use Pure Go SQLite (No CGO Required)

```go
dbConfig := database.Config{
    Type:     "sqlite-pure",
    FilePath: "user_api.db",
}
```

### Option 2: Use Standard SQLite (Requires CGO)

```go
dbConfig := database.Config{
    Type:     "sqlite",
    FilePath: "user_api.db",
}
```

To compile with CGO enabled:

```bash
# On Windows
set CGO_ENABLED=1
go build -o api.exe ./cmd/api

# On Linux/macOS
export CGO_ENABLED=1
go build -o api ./cmd/api
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Database

```go
dbConfig := database.Config{
    Type:     "mysql", // or "postgres", "mongodb"
    Host:     "localhost",
    Port:     "3306",
    User:     "username",
    Password: "password",
    DBName:   "database_name",
}
```
